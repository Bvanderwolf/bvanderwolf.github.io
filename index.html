										During the Global Game Jam NL 2021 I worked toghether with a team of friends from the University
										on a game called Bob's Mayhem. Bob's mayhem is about an employee at an airport matching luggage descriptions
										to luggage items on a very chaotic first day. Out of 93 entries we ranked 3rd with 27 ratings (Score: 4.067).

									<p>
										During this project I worked the drop point and its interactions with the player, a scriptable object event system
										for taking care of the gameplay events during the game and creating a gameplay loop making it possible to play through
										the game multiple times without closing the application.

										Hunter Gatherers is a multiplayer real-time strategy game in which you
